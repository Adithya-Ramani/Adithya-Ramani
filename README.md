The applications of python in capital markets is something that has always intrigued me.
I am a self-taught coder. I have learnt python on my own and aim to expand its applications into corporate finance, 
to bring in a cognitive approach to financial markets, globally. 

I am currently tech-skilling myself in the areas of various tools that aid transformation. 
I have built a few finance related projects using python coding. 
The source code of which is posted in my repository (We can collaborate to enhance the same).
