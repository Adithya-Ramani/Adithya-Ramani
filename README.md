I a working in the Statutory Audit department in Deloitte. Apart from Audit, i am passionate about financial and capital markets. I love to watch their movements and how they shape up the global economy, with their price waves. 

I am a self-taught coder. I have learnt python own and aim to expand its applications into corporate finance, to bring in a cognitive approach to financial markets, globally. The applications of python in capital markets is something that has always intrigued me.

I am currently tech-skilling myself in the areas of python and capital markets. I have built a few finance related projects using python coding. The source code of which is posted in my repository (We can collaborate to enhance the same).
