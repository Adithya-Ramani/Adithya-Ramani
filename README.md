Apart from Audit, i am passionate about financial and capital markets. I love to watch their movements and how they shape up the economy. 

I am a self-taught coder. I have learnt python on my own and aim to expand its applications into finance and the stock markets world. 

I am currently upskilling my levels at both python and the capital markets. I have built various finance related projects using python, the source codes is put in my repository.
